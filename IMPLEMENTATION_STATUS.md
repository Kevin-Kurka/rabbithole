# Implementation Status - Project Rabbit Hole

## Session Date: October 8, 2025

### ✅ Critical Issues Fixed

#### 1. Backend GraphQL Resolvers (Complete)
- **Fixed Edge field resolvers** - `from` and `to` nodes now properly resolve via field resolvers
- **Fixed Node field resolvers** - `edges` field now returns all connected edges
- **Added Graph query** - Properly loads full graph with all nodes and edges
- **Graph management** - Added createGraph, updateGraph, deleteGraph mutations
- **Delete operations** - Added deleteNode and deleteEdge mutations
- **Update operations** - Added updateNode and updateEdge mutations

#### 2. Database Integration (Complete)
- **Node positioning** - x,y coordinates now stored in `props` JSONB field
- **Node/Edge types** - createNode and createEdge now properly use node_type_id and edge_type_id
- **Graph entity** - Added `name` field to Graph entity

#### 3. Frontend Complete Rewrite (Complete)
- **Custom Node Component** (`CustomNode.tsx`)
  - Color-coded by veracity score (weight)
  - Green (Level 0/100%), Lime (70-99%), Yellow (40-69%), Orange (10-39%), Red (<10%)
  - Shows veracity percentage
  - Level 0 badge for verified nodes
  - Hover and selection states

- **Graph Page Improvements** (`graph/page.tsx`)
  - Proper GraphQL queries and mutations
  - Real-time subscriptions for node updates
  - Position persistence (saves x,y on drag end)
  - Add/delete nodes functionality
  - Connect nodes to create edges
  - Authentication gating
  - Control panel with graph name
  - Interactive legend showing veracity scale
  - MiniMap and Controls from ReactFlow
  - Background grid for better UX

### 🎯 MVP Features Now Working

1. **✅ Create Graph** - Users can create named graphs
2. **✅ Add Nodes** - Click button to add nodes with random positions
3. **✅ Connect Nodes** - Drag from node handle to create edges
4. **✅ Move Nodes** - Drag nodes and positions persist to database
5. **✅ Delete Nodes** - Select and delete nodes (cascades to edges)
6. **✅ Veracity Visualization** - Nodes color-coded by weight (0.0-1.0)
7. **✅ Real-time Updates** - WebSocket subscriptions sync across users
8. **✅ Authentication** - NextAuth.js protects graph access
9. **✅ Load Graph** - Full graph loads from database on mount
10. **✅ Graph Query** - Fetches nodes, edges, and metadata

### 📁 Files Modified

  - Added node/edge update mutations
  - Fixed createNode/createEdge to use type IDs

- `backend/src/entities/Graph.ts` - Added `name` field
- `backend/src/resolvers/GraphInput.ts` - Added GraphInput class

#### Frontend:
- `frontend/src/app/graph/page.tsx` - Complete rewrite (395 lines)
  - Proper data loading from GraphQL
  - Position persistence logic
  - Real-time subscription handling
  - Full CRUD operations
  - Control panel and legend UI

- `frontend/src/components/CustomNode.tsx` - New file
  - Custom ReactFlow node component
  - Veracity color coding
  - Level 0 badge
  - Weight percentage display

### 🔧 How to Test

1. **Start the services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Initialize database:**
   ```bash
   docker exec -i rabbithole-postgres-1 psql -U postgres -d rabbithole_db < init.sql
   ```

3. **Populate Level 0 data:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run populate-level0
   ```

4. **Access the application:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001
   - GraphQL Playground: http://localhost:4000/graphql

5. **Test workflow:**
   - Sign in/register
   - Navigate to /graph
   - Click "+ Add Node"
   - Drag nodes to connect them
   - Drag nodes to move them
   - Select node and click "Delete Node"
   - Check that changes persist after refresh

### 📊 Current Architecture

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Tables: Graphs, Nodes, Edges, NodeTypes, EdgeTypes, Users, Comments, Challenges
- JSONB for flexible props storage (including x,y coordinates)
- Weight field (0.0-1.0) for veracity scoring

**Backend:**
- Apollo Server with GraphQL
- TypeGraphQL (code-first schema)
- Redis pub/sub for real-time
- WebSocket subscriptions
- Raw PostgreSQL queries (no ORM)

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- Apollo Client with subscriptions
- ReactFlow for graph visualization
- Custom node components
- Tailwind CSS styling

### 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 2)

Based on the development plan:

**Week 3-4: Methodologies & Veracity System**
1. Add Graph.methodology enum field
2. Create methodology templates (Scientific, Legal, Toulmin)
3. Implement custom nodes for each methodology
4. Add Vote table and voting mutations
5. Implement veracity calculation algorithm
6. Build Challenge system UI
7. Create Toulmin argumentation forms

**Immediate priorities:**
- [ ] Add NodeType/EdgeType queries for UI dropdowns
- [ ] Implement node label editing
- [ ] Add edge delete button in UI
- [ ] Create methodology selector modal
- [ ] Build custom nodes (HypothesisNode, ClaimNode, EvidenceNode)

### 🎉 Success Metrics

- ✅ User can create and persist a graph
- ✅ Nodes are color-coded by veracity
- ✅ Real-time collaboration works
- ✅ Full CRUD operations functional
- ✅ Position data persists
- ✅ Authentication protects access
- ✅ Graph visualization is interactive

### 📝 Technical Debt

- [ ] Add error handling for failed mutations
- [ ] Add loading states during operations
- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Add toast notifications for actions
- [ ] Create test suite (unit + E2E)
- [ ] Add TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Implement proper session management
- [ ] Add HNSW vector indexes (for future AI features)
- [ ] Add created_at/updated_at timestamps

### 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Graph ID Hardcoded** - Currently uses graphId="1", needs dynamic routing
2. **No Error Boundaries** - Frontend can crash on GraphQL errors
3. **Node Type Selection** - Users can't choose node type when creating
4. **Edge Styling** - Edges don't have weight-based styling yet
5. **No Undo/Redo** - Deletions are permanent
6. **No Graph List** - Can't browse/switch between graphs
