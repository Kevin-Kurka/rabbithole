  graph(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    description
    methodologyId
    nodes {
      id
      weight
      props
      level

      from { id }
      to { id }
      weight
      props
      level
      createdAt
      updatedAt
    }
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    createdBy {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### Mutations Used

---

## Data Flow

### 1. Graph Selection Flow
```
User opens CommandMenu (Cmd+K or FAB button)
  → User selects graph from list
    → onToggleGraph() sets activeGraphs state
      → currentGraphId updated (first active graph)
        → GraphCanvas renders with graphId prop
          → GRAPH_QUERY fetches graph data
            → Nodes and edges transformed to React Flow format
              → Canvas renders with veracity colors
```

### 2. Node Creation Flow
```
User connects two nodes OR uses context menu
  → CREATE_NODE_MUTATION called
    → Backend creates node in database
      → NODE_CREATED_SUBSCRIPTION fires
        → All connected clients receive update
          → GraphCanvas adds new node to state
            → Node appears on canvas with veracity color
```

### 3. Real-time Update Flow
```
Another user updates a node
  → Backend mutation executes
    → NODE_UPDATED_SUBSCRIPTION fires
      → Current user receives update
        → GraphCanvas updates node in state
          → Node visual updates (color, label, etc.)
```

## Veracity Visualization

### Color Scheme
The veracity score (weight) determines node and edge colors:

| Score Range | Color | Hex | Meaning |
|------------|-------|-----|---------|
| 1.0 (Level 0) | Green | #10b981 | Verified, read-only |
| 0.7 - 0.99 | Lime | #84cc16 | High confidence |
| 0.4 - 0.69 | Yellow | #eab308 | Medium confidence |
| 0.1 - 0.39 | Orange | #f97316 | Low confidence |
| 0.0 - 0.09 | Red | #ef4444 | Provisional |

### Visual Indicators

#### Nodes
- Background color based on weight
- Lock icon in top-right corner for Level 0 nodes
- Veracity badge showing "Level 0 - Verified" or "XX% confidence"
- Methodology tag (if present)
- Border color darker shade of background
- Selection ring in blue (#3b82f6)

#### Edges
- Stroke color based on weight
- Lock icon in label for Level 0 edges
- Edge label shows "Verified" or "XX%" confidence
- Low confidence edges (< 40%) have animated dashed lines
- Thicker stroke for Level 0 edges (2.5px vs 2px)

#### Minimap
- Nodes colored by veracity for quick overview
- Level 0 nodes always green
- Gradient visualization of graph confidence

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open /graph page
2. Verify authentication redirect works
3. Click FAB button to open CommandMenu
4. Select a graph from the list
5. Verify GraphCanvas renders with nodes and edges
6. Check veracity colors are correct:
   - Level 0 nodes are green with lock icons
   - Other nodes colored by weight
7. Test node interactions:
   - Drag a Level 1 node (should work)
   - Try to drag a Level 0 node (should be locked)
   - Right-click node to see context menu
8. Test edge creation:
   - Drag from node handle to another node
   - Verify edge appears
   - Check edge color matches veracity
9. Test real-time updates:
   - Open page in two browser tabs
   - Create node in one tab
   - Verify it appears in other tab
10. Test keyboard shortcuts:
    - Press Cmd+K to open menu
    - Press Escape to close
    - Select node and press Delete
11. Test error handling:
    - Disconnect network
    - Try to create node
    - Verify error notification appears

### Expected Results
- All colors match veracity scheme
- Lock icons appear on Level 0 items
- Context menu disables locked operations
- Real-time updates work bidirectionally
- No console errors
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive to window resize

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
1. **Memoization**: GraphNode and GraphEdge are memoized with React.memo
2. **Lazy Updates**: Position updates only saved on drag end, not during drag
3. **Subscription Filtering**: Subscriptions filtered by graphId
4. **History Limiting**: Max 50 history items to prevent memory leaks
5. **Debounced Updates**: Auto-save debounced to prevent excessive mutations
6. **React Flow Optimizations**: snapToGrid, fitView enabled

### Known Limitations
- Large graphs (>1000 nodes) may experience slowdown
- Real-time updates can cause jitter if multiple users edit simultaneously
- History size limit means undo only works for recent changes

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Multi-Graph Overlay**: Support viewing multiple graphs simultaneously
2. **Graph Layers**: Toggle visibility of different node types
3. **Search/Filter**: Search nodes by label or properties
4. **Zoom to Node**: Jump to specific node by ID
5. **Export**: Export graph as PNG, SVG, or JSON
6. **Collaboration Cursors**: Show other users' cursors in real-time
7. **Node Grouping**: Group related nodes visually
8. **Edge Routing**: Smarter edge paths to avoid node overlap
9. **Performance Mode**: Simplified rendering for large graphs
10. **Undo/Redo Sync**: Share undo history across users

### Technical Improvements
1. **Virtual Rendering**: Only render visible nodes for large graphs
2. **Web Workers**: Offload layout calculations
3. **IndexedDB Caching**: Cache graph data locally
4. **Optimistic Updates**: Show changes immediately, sync later
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle simultaneous edits better
6. **Progressive Loading**: Load nodes in chunks
7. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse WebSocket connections
8. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful degradation on component errors
