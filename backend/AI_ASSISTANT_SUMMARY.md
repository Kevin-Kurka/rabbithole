---

## Design Principles Implemented

### 1. AI as Guide, Not Authority ✅

**What AI CAN do:**
- Suggest next steps ("You might consider...")
- Flag potential issues
- Recommend evidence sources
- Answer questions
- Provide educational explanations

**What AI CANNOT do:**
- Approve or reject graphs
- Block workflow progression
- Make decisions for users
- Enforce methodology rules
- Access or modify user data without permission

**Language Examples:**
```
✅ "You might consider creating a Solution node..."
✅ "It could be helpful to explore the Environment category..."
✅ "One approach might be to ask a fifth why question..."

❌ "You must add a Solution node"
❌ "This graph is invalid"
❌ "You need to fix this before continuing"
```

---

### 2. Transparent Reasoning ✅

All AI suggestions include:
- **Why** the suggestion is being made
- **Rationale** based on methodology best practices
- **Context** about the current graph state
- **Options** rather than mandates

Example:
```
"You might consider adding a Solution node. The 5 Whys methodology typically
ends with actionable solutions after identifying the root cause. This helps
ensure your analysis leads to concrete improvements. However, if you're still
exploring causes, feel free to continue that investigation first."
```

---

### 3. Methodology-Aware Context ✅

AI adapts its guidance based on:
- Current methodology being used
- Workflow step progression
- Node and edge types present
- Required vs optional properties
- Methodology category (analytical, strategic, etc.)

---

### 4. Rate Limiting & Cost Control ✅

**Rate Limiting:**
- 10 AI requests per user per hour
- Per-user tracking in memory
- Graceful error messages
- UI can show remaining requests

**Cost Control:**
- Token limits (1000 max per response)
- Caching for common queries
- Conversation pruning (last 20 messages)
- Estimated $0.02-0.03 per request

---

### 5. Error Handling & Resilience ✅

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Service initializes even if OpenAI unavailable
- Friendly error messages for users
- Fallback responses when API fails
- Detailed logging for debugging

**Error Types Handled:**
- Missing API key
- Rate limit exceeded
- Invalid input
- Authentication required
- API timeouts
- Network errors

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Get Next Step Guidance

```graphql
query {
  getMethodologyGuidance(graphId: "abc-123")
}
```

**Response:**
```
"Based on your 5 Whys analysis, you've asked why twice. You might consider
creating a third why node to continue drilling down toward the root cause.
The goal is to reach the point where asking why again would take you outside
your control or become too abstract to act on..."
```

---

### Example 2: Detect Issues

```graphql
query {
  detectGraphInconsistencies(graphId: "abc-123")
}
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  "You have 2 isolated nodes not connected to the main graph...",
  "A Root Cause node is missing the 'confidence' property...",
  "Overall, your graph structure looks logically sound!"
]
```

---

### Example 3: Suggest Evidence

```graphql
query {
  suggestEvidenceSources(nodeId: "node-456") {
    type
    description
    searchQuery
    priority
    rationale
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "type": "source",
    "description": "Look for primary sources from the time period",
    "searchQuery": "manufacturing defect 2023 primary source",
    "priority": 5,
    "rationale": "Primary sources provide most direct evidence"
  }
]
```

---

### Example 4: Chat with AI

```graphql
mutation {
  askAIAssistant(
    graphId: "abc-123"
    question: "How do I know if I've found the real root cause?"
  )
}
```

**Response:**
```
"Great question! In a 5 Whys analysis, you've likely reached the root cause when:

1. Asking 'why' again would take you outside your control (external factors)
2. The answer becomes too abstract to be actionable
3. You start repeating earlier answers (circular reasoning)
4. You've uncovered a process, policy, or system issue you can change

Looking at your current graph, you've asked why 4 times and reached
'inadequate training procedures.' You might consider asking one more why:
'Why are training procedures inadequate?' This could reveal if it's a
resource, policy, or oversight issue..."
```

---

### Example 5: Check Compliance

```graphql
query {
  checkMethodologyCompliance(graphId: "abc-123") {
    complianceScore
    isCompliant
    methodologyName
    issues {
      severity
      message
      suggestion
    }
    overallAssessment
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "complianceScore": 85,
  "isCompliant": true,
  "methodologyName": "5 Whys Root Cause Analysis",
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "warning",
      "message": "Consider adding a Solution node",
      "suggestion": "The workflow recommends creating solutions..."
    }
  ],
  "overallAssessment": "Your graph shows 85% alignment with methodology..."
}
```

## Architecture

```
Frontend (React)
    ↓
GraphQL API (AIAssistantResolver)
    ↓
Service Layer (AIAssistantService)
    ↓
    ├─→ PostgreSQL (Graph Data)
    └─→ OpenAI API (GPT-4 Turbo)
```

**Data Flow:**
1. User makes request via GraphQL
2. Resolver validates input and auth
3. Service fetches graph context from DB
4. Service builds methodology-aware prompt
5. Service calls OpenAI API
6. Response formatted and returned
7. Conversation cached in memory

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- ✅ All 6 queries work correctly
- ✅ Both mutations work correctly
- ✅ Rate limiting enforces 10/hour limit
- ✅ Errors handled gracefully
- ✅ Methodology-specific prompts accurate
- ✅ Conversation history maintained
- ✅ Clear conversation works

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run tests
npm test -- AIAssistantService.test.ts
npm test -- AIAssistantResolver.test.ts

# Check coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Load Testing
```bash
# Test with 10 concurrent users
node test/load/ai-assistant-load.test.js
```

---

## Performance & Costs

### Performance
- **Response Time:** 2-20 seconds (depends on hardware)
- **Throughput:** Limited only by your hardware
- **Caching:** In-memory for conversations
- **Scaling:** Runs on local machine (CPU or GPU)

### Estimated Costs
- **Per Request:** $0.00 (FREE!)
- **Per User/Month:** $0.00 (FREE!)
- **100 Users/Month:** $0.00 (FREE!)
- **Only Cost:** Your electricity bill for running the server

### Model Recommendations
- **llama3.2** (3B params) - Best balance of speed and quality
- **llama3.2:1b** (1B params) - Fastest, lower quality
- **mistral** (7B params) - Better quality, slower
- **llama3.1** (8B params) - High quality, requires more RAM

---

2. **Response Time:** Average latency
3. **Error Rate:** Failed requests %
4. **Cost per Request:** OpenAI API costs
5. **User Engagement:** Active users
6. **Rate Limit Hits:** How often users hit limit

### Logging
```typescript
console.log('AI Request:', {
  userId: 'user-123',
  graphId: 'graph-456',
  queryType: 'guidance',
  responseTime: 2.3,
  tokensUsed: 850,
  cost: 0.025
