# Process Validation System - Quick Start Guide

## 30-Second Overview

**What:** Objective, math-based promotion system for graphs
**Why:** Eliminates curator authority, enables egalitarian participation
**How:** 4 criteria all >= 80% â†’ automatic promotion

## The 4 Criteria

```
âœ“ Methodology: 80% of required steps complete
âœ“ Consensus:   80% weighted community approval (min 3 votes)
âœ“ Evidence:    80% average evidence quality
âœ“ Challenges:  0 open challenges (binary: all resolved = 100%)
```

## Quick Usage

### Check if Graph is Ready

```graphql
query {
  getPromotionEligibility(graphId: "your-graph-id") {
    overall_score
    is_eligible
    missing_requirements
  }
}
```

### Vote on Promotion

```graphql
mutation {
  submitConsensusVote(
    graphId: "your-graph-id"
    voteValue: 0.9  # 0.0-1.0
    reasoning: "Strong evidence and complete methodology"
  ) {
    vote_weight
    voter_reputation_score
  }
}
```

### Mark Step Complete

```graphql
mutation {
  markWorkflowStepComplete(
    graphId: "your-graph-id"
    stepId: "step-uuid"
  ) {
    step_name
    completed_at
  }
}
```

### Request Promotion

```graphql
mutation {
  requestPromotionEvaluation(graphId: "your-graph-id") {
    promotion_successful
    new_level
    promotion_message
  }
}
```

**Result:** If eligible â†’ automatic promotion! ðŸŽ‰

## Vote Value Guide

- **1.0** = Strongly approve
- **0.8-0.99** = Approve with minor reservations
- **0.5-0.79** = Neutral / needs improvement
- **0.0-0.49** = Reject promotion

## Building Reputation

Your vote weight = `MAX(your_reputation, 0.5)`

Increase reputation by:
- Submitting quality evidence (40% weight)
- Voting consistently with community (30% weight)
- Completing methodology workflows (20% weight)
- Resolving challenges constructively (10% weight)

## Real-time Tracking

```graphql
subscription {
  promotionEligibilityUpdated(graphId: "your-graph-id") {
    overall_score
    is_eligible
  }
}
```

Updates automatically when:
- Someone votes
- Step completed
- Evidence added
- Challenge resolved

## Key Principles

1. **No Authority** - Anyone can participate
2. **Objective Math** - Clear formulas, no discretion
3. **Transparent** - All scores visible
4. **Automatic** - Promotion when criteria met
5. **Auditable** - Complete history logged

## Common Workflows

### Promote Your Graph

1. Complete methodology steps â†’ `markWorkflowStepComplete`
2. Add quality evidence â†’ already in system
3. Resolve challenges â†’ already in system
4. Request community votes â†’ share graph link
5. Request evaluation â†’ `requestPromotionEvaluation`
6. **Automatic promotion!** âœ¨

### Participate in Community

1. Review graph â†’ `getMethodologyProgress`, `getConsensusStatus`
2. Check evidence quality â†’ `graph.nodes.evidence`
3. Verify no open challenges â†’ `graph.challenges`
4. Vote with reasoning â†’ `submitConsensusVote`
5. Your vote contributes to consensus!

## Troubleshooting

**"Why isn't my graph eligible?"**
```graphql
query {
  getPromotionEligibility(graphId: "...") {
    missing_requirements  # Shows exactly what's needed
  }
}
```

**"How do I increase my vote weight?"**
```graphql
query {
  getUserReputation(userId: "...") {
    overall_reputation_score
    evidence_quality_score  # Focus here for biggest impact
  }
}
```

**"When will promotion happen?"**
- Call `requestPromotionEvaluation` when ready
- If all criteria >= 80%, promotion is immediate
- No manual review or approval needed
