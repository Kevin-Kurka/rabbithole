# Architecture Decision Record: Egalitarian Process Validation System

## ADR-008: Replacing Curator Hierarchy with Objective Process Validation

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Author**: Process Architecture Team

## Context

The original PRD specified a curator role for Level 0 promotion decisions, creating a hierarchical authority structure that contradicts the platform's collaborative intelligence goals. This curator-based approach introduces several critical problems:

1. **Single Points of Failure**: Curators become bottlenecks and potential corruption vectors
2. **Power Concentration**: Creates an elite class that undermines community trust
3. **Subjective Gatekeeping**: Human judgment introduces bias and inconsistency
4. **Scaling Limitations**: Curator availability limits platform growth
5. **Gaming Vulnerability**: Bad actors could target or become curators

The platform requires a system where **every participant has equal opportunity** to contribute to truth validation, with promotion to Level 0 based on **objective, measurable criteria** rather than human authority.

## Decision

We will implement an **Egalitarian Process Validation System** that replaces curator roles with mathematical consensus mechanisms and objective promotion criteria. This system operates on these principles:

### Core Principles

1. **No Hierarchical Roles**: All users participate equally in validation
2. **Objective Criteria**: Promotion based on measurable thresholds
3. **Transparent Process**: Real-time visibility of all requirements
4. **Automatic Promotion**: System executes promotion when criteria met
5. **Methodology Compliance**: AI guides but doesn't gatekeep
6. **Evidence-Based Weighting**: Vote influence based on evidence quality, not user status

### System Architecture

```
User Graph (Level 1)
        │
        ├── Methodology Compliance Check (AI-guided)
        │   ├── Required steps completed?
        │   ├── Required node types present?
        │   └── Required edges documented?
        │
        ├── Evidence Quality Assessment (Automated)
        │   ├── Source credibility scoring
        │   ├── Temporal relevance check
        │   └── Cross-reference validation
        │
        ├── Community Consensus Building (Democratic)
        │   ├── Weighted voting by evidence quality
        │   ├── Minimum participation threshold
        │   └── Challenge resolution period
        │
        └── Automatic Promotion Decision (Mathematical)
            ├── All criteria met? → Level 0
            └── Criteria not met? → Remain Level 1
```

### Promotion Criteria Matrix

| Criterion | Threshold | Measurement | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Methodology Completion | 100% | All required workflow steps | Ensures rigor |
| Evidence Quality | >0.7 avg | Automated credibility scoring | Filters misinformation |
| Source Diversity | ≥3 sources | Independent source count | Prevents single-source bias |
| Community Agreement | ≥80% | Weighted consensus percentage | Democratic validation |
| Minimum Participation | ≥5 users | Unique participant count | Prevents manipulation |
| Challenge Status | 0 open | Unresolved challenge count | Ensures scrutiny |
| Temporal Relevance | <2 years | Evidence age for time-sensitive claims | Maintains currency |

### Vote Weighting Formula

```
vote_weight = base_weight × evidence_quality_multiplier × diversity_bonus

where:
- base_weight = 1.0 (all users equal)
- evidence_quality_multiplier = avg(provided_evidence_credibility_scores)
- diversity_bonus = 1 + (0.1 × number_of_unique_sources_cited)

Maximum vote_weight = 3.0 (prevents domination)
```

### Anti-Gaming Mechanisms

1. **Sybil Attack Prevention**
   - IP address clustering detection
   - Account age requirements (>7 days)
   - Behavioral pattern analysis
   - CAPTCHA for suspicious activity

2. **Evidence Gaming Prevention**
   - Duplicate source detection
   - Circular reference detection
   - Temporal consistency checks
   - Cross-validation requirements

3. **Consensus Gaming Prevention**
   - Time-distributed voting windows
   - Random sampling for large graphs
   - Retroactive validation audits
   - Community flagging system

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **True Decentralization**: No power hierarchies or gatekeepers
2. **Scalability**: System scales with community, not curator availability
3. **Transparency**: Everyone sees exact promotion requirements
4. **Objectivity**: Mathematical criteria eliminate subjective bias
5. **Resilience**: No single points of failure or corruption
6. **Inclusivity**: Equal opportunity for all participants
7. **Trust**: Community owns the validation process

### Negative

1. **Initial Complexity**: Learning curve for understanding criteria
2. **Potential for Deadlock**: High thresholds might slow promotions
3. **Gaming Risk**: Sophisticated attacks still possible
4. **Technical Overhead**: Complex calculations and monitoring

### Mitigations

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: UI reveals complexity gradually
2. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust based on empirical data
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: AI flags suspicious patterns
4. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient caching and computation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Implement objective criteria evaluation engine
- Build evidence quality scoring system
- Create methodology compliance tracker

### Phase 2: Consensus (Week 3-4)
- Develop weighted voting mechanism
- Implement anti-gaming measures
- Build real-time criteria dashboard

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 5-6)
- Connect to existing challenge system
- Integrate with AI guidance system
- Deploy automatic promotion engine

### Phase 4: Monitoring (Week 7-8)
- Implement audit trails
- Build analytics dashboards
- Create retroactive validation system

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Modified Curator System
Keep curators but limit their power to tie-breaking votes only.
- **Rejected**: Still creates hierarchy and bottlenecks

### Alternative 2: Pure Democracy
Simple majority voting without evidence weighting.
- **Rejected**: Vulnerable to popularity contests and misinformation

### Alternative 3: AI-Only Validation
Let AI make promotion decisions.
- **Rejected**: Lacks human judgment and community ownership

### Alternative 4: Hybrid Reputation System
Use reputation scores to weight votes.
- **Rejected**: Creates implicit hierarchy over time

## Success Metrics

1. **Promotion Rate**: Target 5-10 Level 0 promotions per week
2. **False Positive Rate**: <1% incorrect promotions requiring reversal
3. **Gaming Detection**: >95% of gaming attempts caught
4. **Community Participation**: >30% of active users participate in validation
5. **Time to Promotion**: Average 7-14 days for legitimate content
6. **Transparency Score**: 100% of criteria publicly visible

## Security Considerations

1. **Audit Trail**: Immutable log of all validation activities
2. **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert malicious promotions
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam and DoS attacks
4. **Cryptographic Signing**: Optional verification of evidence
5. **Decentralized Backup**: Prevent single point of data failure
