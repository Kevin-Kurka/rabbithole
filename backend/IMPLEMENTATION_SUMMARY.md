## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Objective Scoring System

#### Four Promotion Criteria (all must be >= 80%)

**Methodology Completion Score**
```typescript
completed_required_steps / total_required_steps >= 0.8
```
- Tracks objective completion of workflow steps
- Required steps must be completed
- Optional steps don't block promotion

**Consensus Score**
```typescript
SUM(vote_value * vote_weight) / SUM(vote_weight) >= 0.8
AND total_votes >= 3
```
- Weighted community voting
- Minimum 3 votes required
- Vote weight based on reputation

**Evidence Quality Score**
```typescript
AVG(evidence.confidence) >= 0.8
```
- Average quality of all evidence in graph
- Simple, transparent calculation
- High-quality sources prioritized

**Challenge Resolution Score**
```typescript
open_challenges == 0 ? 1.0 : 0.0
```
- Binary check (no partial credit)
- All challenges must be resolved
- Zero tolerance for unresolved disputes

### 2. User Reputation System

**Reputation Formula (objective calculation)**
```typescript
overall_reputation_score =
  evidence_quality_score * 0.4 +      // Quality of evidence submitted
  vote_alignment_score * 0.3 +        // Accuracy of voting patterns
  (methodology_completions > 0 ? 0.2 : 0) +  // Systematic work
  (challenges_resolved / challenges_raised) * 0.1  // Dispute resolution
```

**Vote Weighting**
```typescript
vote_weight = MAX(overall_reputation_score, 0.5)
```
- Everyone has minimum weight of 0.5
- Maximum weight of 1.0 earned through quality contributions
- No hard-coded special privileges

### 3. Automatic Promotion

**No Human Approval Required**
```typescript
if (all_scores >= 0.8) {
  // Automatically promote
  update_graph_level(current_level + 1);
  log_promotion_event();
  publish_notification();
}
```
- System automatically promotes when criteria met
- No curator review or approval
- Instant feedback via subscriptions

### 4. Complete Transparency

**All Data Public**
- Eligibility scores visible to everyone
- Vote reasoning publicly accessible
- Audit trail of all promotions
- Complete history of score changes

**Reproducible Results**
- Same inputs always yield same outputs
- No discretion or interpretation
- Mathematical formulas documented
- Can verify calculations independently

### 5. Real-time Updates

**GraphQL Subscriptions**
```graphql
subscription {
  promotionEligibilityUpdated(graphId: "...") {
    overall_score
    is_eligible
  }
}
```
- Live progress tracking
- Instant notification of criteria changes
- UI updates without polling

## GraphQL API Surface

### Queries (5)
- `getPromotionEligibility(graphId)` - Current eligibility status
- `getMethodologyProgress(graphId)` - Workflow completion tracking
- `getConsensusStatus(graphId)` - Voting statistics
- `getConsensusVotes(graphId)` - All votes with reasoning
- `getUserReputation(userId)` - Objective reputation scores

### Mutations (3)
- `submitConsensusVote(graphId, voteValue, reasoning?)` - Submit/update vote
- `markWorkflowStepComplete(graphId, stepId)` - Mark step done
- `requestPromotionEvaluation(graphId)` - Evaluate and auto-promote

### Subscriptions (2)
- `promotionEligibilityUpdated(graphId)` - Real-time eligibility changes
- `graphPromoted(graphId)` - Notification of level-up

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
1. **ConsensusVotes** - Community voting records
2. **MethodologyWorkflowSteps** - Workflow step definitions
3. **MethodologyStepCompletions** - Completion tracking
4. **PromotionEvents** - Auditable promotion log
5. **UserReputationCache** - Cached reputation scores
6. **PromotionEligibilityCache** - Cached eligibility results

### Performance Optimizations
- Composite indexes on frequently queried columns
- Automatic cache invalidation via triggers
- Materialized views for common queries
- Batch updates for reputation changes

## Egalitarian Design Principles

### ✓ No Authority Checks
- Anyone can view all scores and data
- Anyone can vote (weighted by reputation)
- No special roles or curator approval
- No gatekeepers or discretionary decisions

### ✓ Objective Math
- Clear formulas for all calculations
- Reproducible results
- No interpretation required
- Binary thresholds (pass/fail)

### ✓ Transparent

## Comparison to Traditional Systems

| Aspect | Traditional Curator | Rabbithole Process Validation |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Authority | Curators decide | Math decides |
| Transparency | Opaque | All scores visible |
| Speed | Slow (human review) | Instant (automatic) |
| Bias | Potential for bias | Objective formulas |
| Access | Limited to curators | Open to everyone |
| Consistency | Varies by curator | Always consistent |
| Scalability | Limited by curators | Infinitely scalable |
| Auditability | Hard to audit | Complete audit trail |

## Philosophy Embodied

> **Knowledge should be validated by objective criteria, not authority figures.**

This implementation demonstrates that:
- Quality can be measured objectively
- Community consensus emerges organically
- Process adherence is verifiable
- Decisions can be reproducible
- Authority is not necessary

The system assumes good faith but relies on:
- Multiple independent criteria (can't game one)
- Reputation-weighted voting (quality matters)
- Transparent reasoning (accountability)
- Complete audit trails (provability)

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Potential Improvements
1. Dynamic thresholds based on graph complexity
2. Time-based decay for stale consensus votes
3. Weighted methodology steps (importance levels)
4. Reputation decay for inactive users
5. Challenge severity weighting

### Maintaining Principles
All enhancements must:
- Remain objective and mathematical
- Avoid introducing human discretion
- Maintain transparency and auditability
- Preserve "anyone can participate" ethos

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- Integrates with Graph/Node/Edge system
- Uses Evidence and VeracityScore data
- Connects to Challenge resolution
- Leverages Methodology workflows

### Frontend Integration
```typescript
// Real-time progress tracking
const { data } = useSubscription(PROMOTION_ELIGIBILITY_UPDATED, {
  variables: { graphId }
});

// UI updates automatically:
// Methodology: [████████░░] 80%
// Consensus:   [██████████] 100%
// Evidence:    [█████████░] 90%
// Challenges:  [██████████] 100%
// Overall:     [████████░░] 80% ✓ ELIGIBLE
```
